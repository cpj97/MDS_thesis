**Abstract**

This research explores deforestation trends in Colombia between 2010 and 2022 using interpretable machine learning techniques. By combining a comprehensive municipal-level panel dataset with advanced modelling, and analysis strategies, the study tends to identify the predominant drivers of forest loss in the country, including illicit coca cultivation, spatial marginality, and conflict-related factors. Seven regression models were trained and evaluated, with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) delivering the best predictive performance. Feature importance analysis, conducted via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), highlights significant regional and temporal variations in deforestation dynamics, emphasizing the complex, non-linear interactions among socio-economic, environmental, and institutional variables. Spatial clustering and biogeographic regional analysis reveal differentiated drivers across regions, particularly in high-deforestation areas like the Andes–Amazon Transition Belt. The findings underscore the need for tailored, region-specific policy interventions that integrate conflict mitigation, rural development, and economic diversification strategies to control deforestation. This research contributes to the environmental analysis literature by demonstrating the value of machine learning methods for enhancing the understanding of complex land-use change dynamics in Colombia.
